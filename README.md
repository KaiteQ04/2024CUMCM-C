# 2024CUMCM-C
My mathematical modeling contest project of 2024 National College Mathematical Modeling Contest – Problem C：Optimal Multi-Year Crop Planting Planning under Constraints and Uncertainties.

This repository contains the code, data, and models used to solve the problem.
The solution consists of:
Linear Programming (LP) optimization using OR-Tools; 
Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization using DEAP; 
Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty; 
Full data preprocessing pipeline; 
Scalable multi-year planning framework
