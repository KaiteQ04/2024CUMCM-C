My Mathematical Modeling Contest project (crop planting optimization)
2024 National College Mathematical Modeling Contest – Problem C
Optimal Multi-Year Crop Planting Planning under Constraints

This repository contains the code, data, and models used to solve Problem C of the 2024 National College Mathematical Modeling Contest.
The solution consists of:
Linear Programming (LP) optimization using OR-Tools
Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization using DEAP
Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty
Full data preprocessing pipeline
Scalable multi-year planning framework
